This file is recorded new words that I meet first. 

struct {
    param w : New word or word phrases [ meanings in CN ],
    param p(number) : Page number of the word.
}



w : operand [n. 操作数; 运算数;],
p(42) : The input operator returns its left operand, which in this case is std::cin.

w : compound assignment operator [n. 复合赋值运算符;],
p(42) : The while body uses the compound assignment operator to add the current value to the evolving sum.

w : detect [vt. 查明; 侦察; 发现;],
p(42) :  A compiler cannot detect whether a program does what its author intends, but it can detect errors in the form of the program.

w : colloquially [adv. 口语地; 用通俗语;]，
p(43) : The value 10, for example, has a type of int (or, more colloquially, “is an int”).

w : cascade [n. 大量; 瀑布; v. 倾泻而下; 垂落; 悬挂;],
p(43) : Often a single error can have a cascading effect and cause a compiler to report more errors than actually are present.
